I wrote a paper in economics class discussing the economic and poltical problems of  Venzuela, I used some light data and some poltical analysis to diagnose Venzuela's problems mostly attributing Venzuela's economic problems to politics and social unrest then providing economic and political solutions to their wide array of social, poltical, and economic problems. I want to go a step further, and analyze data to both identify additional economic problems, and provide solutions based off that data similarly to ones in the paper. There may some comparisons to other countries, as a point of reference. I will provide the paper I completed attached as a reference.**"
